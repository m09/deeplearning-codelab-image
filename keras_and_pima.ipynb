It describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Define Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in Keras are defined as a sequence of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a Sequential model and add layers one at a time until we are happy with our network topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the right number of inputs. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input_dim argument and setting it to 8 for the 8 input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know the number of layers and their types?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very hard question. There are heuristics that we can use and often the best network structure is found through a process of trial and error experimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure of the problem if that helps at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers are defined using the Dense class. We can specify the number of neurons in the layer as the first argument, the initialization method as the second argument as init and specify the activation function using the activation argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we initialize the network weights to a small random number generated from a uniform distribution (‘uniform‘), in this case between 0 and 0.05 because that is the default uniform weight initialization in Keras. Another traditional alternative would be ‘normal’ for small random numbers generated from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the rectifier (‘relu‘) activation function on the first two layers and the sigmoid function in the output layer. It used to be the case that sigmoid and tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is achieved using the rectifier activation function. We use a sigmoid on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can piece it all together by adding each layer. The first layer has 12 neurons and expects 8 input variables. The second hidden layer has 8 neurons and finally, the output layer has 1 neuron to predict the class (onset of diabetes or not)."

The backend automatically chooses the best way to represent the network for training and making predictions to run on your hardware, such as CPU or GPU or even distributed.\n",

    "When compiling, we must specify some additional properties required when training the network. Remember training a network means finding the best set of weights to make predictions for this problem.\n",

We will also use the efficient gradient descent algorithm “adam” for no other reason that it is an efficient default. Learn more about the Adam optimization algorithm in the paper [“Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization“](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980).\n",
